<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Execution-Executor-Procedure (EEP) ODP imports the AffectedBy ODP (https://w3id.org/affectedBy), that involves classes for Features of Interest and their intrinsic Properties/Qualities. 

The EEP ODP is an adaptation of the Procedure Execution Ontology (PEP) (https://w3id.org/pep/pep-1.1) from the SEAS ontology which, in turn, is a generalization of the Observation-Sensor-Procedure and Actuation-Actuator-Procedure patterns used in the SOSA (http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/) and SSN (http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/) ontologies.

From the AffectedBy ODP, the EEP ODP imports the notion that a property/quality is intrinsic to the feature of interest that it belongs to (i.e., according to the definition of the class Quality in the DUL ontology http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl).
Apart from the two classes imported from the AffectedBy ODP (aff:FeatureOfIntetest and aff:Quality), the EEP ODP consists of three more classes: Execution, Executor, and Procedure. The class Execution and their three functional object properties: eep:madeBy, eep:usedProcedure, and eep:onQuality, forms the backbone of the ODP. The property eep:madeBy links an execution to its executor, the property eep:usedProcedure links an execution to its procedure, and the property eep:onQuality links an execution to the quality/property concerned by the execution. Therefore, an execution jointly with their three object values of the three aforementioned properties can be considered as a n-ary relationship. Note that every quality belongs to unique feature of interest. Therefore, a feature of interest is involved in the n-ary relationship.

The remaining object properties: eep:implements, that links executors to  procedures, eep:hasFeatureOfInteres, that links executions to features of interest, eep:forQuality, that links executors to qualities, and eep:forFeatureOfInterest, that links executors to features of interest, are defined in terms of the functional object properties using property chain axioms.</span>
